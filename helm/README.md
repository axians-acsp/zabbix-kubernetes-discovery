# Zabbix Kubernetes Discovery Helm Chart

This directory contains a chart for Kubernetes monitoring for Zabbix.
See [the README.md there](./zabbix-kubernetes-discovery/README.md) for
instructions on how to use it.

## Publishing new charts

We use Github pages to publish the chart as a versioned package. The
tarballs and index.yaml file are updated with a script in that branch.
